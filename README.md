I'm a student at Columbia Law School ('22) with an interest in data privacy, open source,
and data analysis, as well as the general interrelationship between law and technology.

I'm a complete novice at any sort of development. I'm currently working on learning Swift and Python, 
with an interest towards SQL, R, and Ruby.
